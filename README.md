# mean-quickstart
Skeleton for an app using MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular 2, NodeJS, Babel and ES6.

Work in progress! 
Current version: 0.0.3

Got inspiration from many other repos and tutorials, especially:
* https://github.com/shuhei/babel-angular2-app
* http://thejackalofjavascript.com//developing-a-mean-app-with-angular-2-0

and obviously, the offical Angular 2 documentation at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html
