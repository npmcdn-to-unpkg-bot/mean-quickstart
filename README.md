# mean-quickstart
Skeleton for an app using MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular 2, NodeJS, Babel-Gulp and ES6.

Work in progress! 
Current version: 0.3.0

Got inspiration from many other repos and tutorials, especially:
* https://github.com/shuhei/babel-angular2-app
* http://thejackalofjavascript.com//developing-a-mean-app-with-angular-2-0

and obviously, the offical Angular 2 documentation at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html

## Usage

1. Clone repo from https://github.com/vmaldosan/mean-quickstart
2. If not already present, install NodeJS.
3. From command line, run ```npm install```.
4. To insert test data, run ```node db\testData.js```.
5. Build with ```gulp build``` (changes can be automatically deployed with ```gulp watch```).
5. Start server with ```node server.js```.
6. Enter http://localhost:3000/ to test the app.
